# 0x03. Sandpiles

a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles

You can assume that both grid1 and grid2 are individually stable
A sandpile is considered stable when none of its cells contains more than 3 grains
When your function is done, grid1 must be stable
grid1 must be printed before each toppling round, only if it is unstable
